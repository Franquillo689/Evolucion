# Genetic algorithm Implementation

This is my first try of a Genetic Algorithm. 
It's a very simple evolution simulation to learn how to code a simple AI of this characteristics.
You can improve the code and documentation or do whatever you want with it. 

# Dependencies
- Python 3
- Numpy (python3 library)

# Parameters
- popmax        -> Amount of individuals
- target        -> String target where AI is trying to get to
- mutation_rate -> Probability of a change of genes of each individual
